# How to protect yourself from Cyber Attacks

In order to prevent the various cyber threats from comprising someones or a corporations data, there are various methods you could apply. *For the average individual*, this is what you can do:

1. Donâ€™t access personal or financial data with public Wi-Fi.
2. Turn off anything you're not using - Hackers can use certain features on your phone to get your information, location or connection. This includes Bluetooth, GPS, Cellular connection, and Personal Hotspot, among other things.
3. Only download trustworthy authenticated apps onto your computer or smart phone.
4. **This is a big one** - Do not use the same password for seperate accounts you may have. If a hacker can crack one account, it could initiate a domino-like effect where they will now be able to access *everything* under your name. Also, do not use a simple password. Make a lengthy password that includes a mixture of upper and lowercase letters, numbers, symbols, etc. I recommend using a password manager like [Dashlane](https://www.dashlane.com/lp/search?utm_source=adwords&utm_campaign=US_Search_Password_Exact&utm_medium=15588320097&utm_term=Password%20Manager&gclid=Cj0KCQjwytOEBhD5ARIsANnRjVgXpLnQMzfUQzmO1Gkc0b4qVwKi8OyBcE4tWltxyKyi2KNR-naTS3UaAnx3EALw_wcB) or [LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com/get-premium?gclid=Cj0KCQjwytOEBhD5ARIsANnRjVgN8zwIgU7tq1iR8y7VuLs40_EzEPP4uDiiWCQgcDOZjfaDdAcNhfEaAi3qEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds).
