# Threats to Cyber Security 

There are many different types of **threats** to cybersecurity. 
### The main ones are:
1. Malware. Software that performs a malicious task on a target device or network, e.g. corrupting data or taking over a system.
2. Phishing. An email-borne attack that involves tricking the email recipient into disclosing confidential information or downloading malware by clicking on a hyperlink in the message.
3. “Man in the Middle” (MitM) attack. Where an attacker establishes a position between the sender and recipient of electronic messages and intercepts them. The sender and recipient believe they are communicating directly with one another. In basic terms, this is considered spying on communications between sender and reciever. 
4. Trojans. Named after the Trojan Horse of ancient Greek history, the Trojan is a type of malware that enters a target system looking like one thing, e.g. a standard piece of software, but then lets out the malicious code once inside the host system.
5. Ransomware. An attack that involves encrypting data on the target system and demanding a ransom in exchange for letting the user have access to the data again. These attacks range from low-level nuisances to serious incidents [like the locking down of the entire city of Atlanta’s municipal government data in 2018](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Atlanta_cyberattack#:~:text=The%20city%20of%20Atlanta%2C%20Georgia,it%20was%20a%20ransomware%20attack.&text=City%20officials%20were%20forced%20to%20complete%20paper%20forms%20by%20hand.), which exposed the credentials and data of possibly 6 million people.

Threats to cybersecurity can come from a wide range of potential hosts. It could be an amateur individual, a team of professionals, or an entire organization dedicated to exposing the vulnerabilities of networks. 
### Normally, cyber attacks comes from the following suspects:
1. Individuals that create attacks using their own software tools
2. Criminal organizations that are run like corporations, with large numbers of employees developing and executing attacks
3. Nation states
4. Terrorists
5. Government Spies
6. Business competitors

These attacks can cause people to lose jobs, their personal information, and their livelihood. It is of upmost importance that cybersecurity should be one of the top investments for companies and citizens to make now and for the foreseeable future.
