# Threats to Cyber Security 

There are many different types of **threats** to cybersecurity. 
### The main ones are:
1. Malware. Software that performs a malicious task on a target device or network, e.g. corrupting data or taking over a system.
2. Phishing. An email-borne attack that involves tricking the email recipient into disclosing confidential information or downloading malware by clicking on a hyperlink in the message.
3. “Man in the Middle” (MitM) attack. Where an attacker establishes a position between the sender and recipient of electronic messages and intercepts them. The sender and recipient believe they are communicating directly with one another. In basic terms, this is considered spying on communications between sender and reciever. 
4. Trojans. Named after the Trojan Horse of ancient Greek history, the Trojan is a type of malware that enters a target system looking like one thing, e.g. a standard piece of software, but then lets out the malicious code once inside the host system.
5. Ransomware. An attack that involves encrypting data on the target system and demanding a ransom in exchange for letting the user have access to the data again. These attacks range from low-level nuisances to serious incidents [like the locking down of the entire city of Atlanta’s municipal government data in 2018](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Atlanta_cyberattack#:~:text=The%20city%20of%20Atlanta%2C%20Georgia,it%20was%20a%20ransomware%20attack.&text=City%20officials%20were%20forced%20to%20complete%20paper%20forms%20by%20hand.).
