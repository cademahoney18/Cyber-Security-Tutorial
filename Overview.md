# Overview of Cyber Security
**Cyber security** is the practice of defending computers, servers, mobile devices, electronic systems, networks, and data from malicious attacks. The term applies in a variety of contexts, from business to mobile computing, and can be divided into a few common categories.
### These categories include:
1. **Network Security** - Securing a computer network from intruders, whether targeted attackers or opportunistic malware.
2. **Application Security** - Focuses on keeping software and devices free of threats. A compromised application could provide access to data.
3. **Information Security** - Protects the integrity and privacy of data.
Cybersecurity is becoming more important due to increased reliance on computer systems, network connnectivity, and technology in general.Contrary to popular belief, not all computer systems are completely impenetrable to cyber attacks, anything can be compromised with enough skill, processing power, and time - even companies that provide cybersecurity services themselves have been breached [before](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/08/technology/fireeye-hacked-russians.html). Owing to its complexity, both in terms of politics and technology, cybersecurity is one of the major challenges in this age of technology.
